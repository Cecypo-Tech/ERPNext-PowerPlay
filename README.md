# ERPNext PowerPlay

A windows based tool to **automate printing of ERPNext documents** based on custom filters.

Uses EFCore to create a SQLite database to store settings and print history.

Example use case: Company has 5 branches, with a central e-invoicing device, that is integrated to update a tax signature on all sales. Once a user submits a document, the e-invoicing signature is appended (this could take a few seconds), after which the user needs to click print preview > print > select a printer > print. Instead of this, the user only submits the document, and within a few seconds, the document is printed, in the correct warehouse, to the preset printer.

Example A5 and Thermal/Roll Paper Templates:
